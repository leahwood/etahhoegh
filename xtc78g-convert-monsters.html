I propose that there should be a building that lets us EASILY convert any monster into an equivalently-starred rainbowmon, and ideally also add a special storage specifically for rainbowmon. By EASILY I mean in a similar manner to how we place monsters into storage. Or perhaps, having a special storage chamber that slowly converts monsters into rainbowmon over the course of a few days when they stay there (and then they stay there, or perhaps even stack within the UI).

Scanned 57 yellowed pages of old law book as pdf now file is monster size of 48 megs and I cannot email it or ftp it. Any advise? I think I should convert it to black and white, but not sure how. I'm under quite some pressure to get the doc out, so, any advice? Using Windows 7, got Adobe Reader. Tried SODA PDF (was PDFSAM I think) and Bullzip, now downloading foxit. I would like to know if I can convert monsters from 3.x editions (I already figured out how to convert monsters from the 1ed) into 2ed monsters. The last edition of DampD I played was 3.5 and that was a long time ago at this point. I'm just old to remember bits of 2e, know what THAC0 stands for, etc. I'd mostly given up on DampD when I saw what a disaster 4e was. From what I could tell, it was just too much like WoW. When I have been playing RPG's I've been using free form systems like Fate to approximate the feel of DampD. After watching some videos and reading comments about how 5e compares to other editions I decided to "take.

In short, the issue with Hunter's Pot is that it only makes sense in champions SO bent out of shape due them being poor duelists/too invade-prove that they're either barely deemed as junglers at this point, or just cause the system to correlate their usage with loss. When you give it a minute of thought, the only places it truly makes sense are names such as Nautilus and Ornn: slower-clearing, utility-driven picks that are overall akin ASKING to have your bonobo laners raging at you because. For Christmas this year, I got the Monster Manual Three. Only problem is, this one is for 4e and I play almost exclusive 3.5. However, I started flipping through the pages anyway out of curiosity. 
Hello! I'm interested in running TFT for a group that exclusively plays DampD. I am slowly familiarizing myself with TFT and beginning to learn the rules, but I have found there appears to be no guidelines or tips on how to create or convert monsters and races for use if they are not found in ITL. I found a mostly decent article on inthelabyrinth.org, and attempted to try converting a tiefling. This guide article uses ADampD, as it is closer to TFT than, say, 5e, so easier to convert. I ran across a bunch of monster conversion guides today and since a lot of people are searching for this info right now, here are the links:. I'm not a reddit native, but I've read enough good ideas, including many from reddit, and I wanted to share my work: a comprehensive Dark Sun guide drawn from a dozen homebrews, ADampD, 3rd edition, 4th, and my own DampD experience in DMing. I lay no claim to the art or many of the original ideas (e.g. defiling rules are converted from 3rd edition). It's still up for editing (I'm not a GM Binder expert, so some formatting issues still exist), but the material from races to classes to equipme. At first converting 3.5 and Pathfinder monsters was looking like an elaborate dance falling somewhere between holistic shamanism and mathematics. It also converts monsters into scorched types. Holy shit. 500+ hours of playing this game and I’m just seeing this now. Crazy how nature made that. Did anyone else know this? I was in awe when I saw a glowing death claw turn into a scorched death. < Back to Fitz's Roleplaying Stuff. Converting DD3.5 Monsters to 5e On The Fly Introduction. This comes from jamesmanhattan on the EnWorld DD5e forums. Anyone else wish we could convert monster parts into furniture and decorations for our room? MHW is a great game but I wish there were more endgame cosmetic customisation options. How cool would it be to mount the head of a Kirin next to your bed, or hang giant Diablos horns on the ceiling? With the new Witcher dlc coming out, maybe we can get some of those trophies that Geralt hangs on Roach. Most hunters have so many Armor sets, if only we could have a display gallery or something. 
In the conversion process, feats from third and fourth edi-tion should usually be ignored, because feats in fifth edition have a very different place in the game than the feats did in those two editions. Feats in fifth edition can make a character concept. Moshi Monsters homepage. Visitors to the site can adopt their very own pet Monster, give it a name and design its color scheme. And to this degree, i'd risk to say even near complete removal of the concept. We're at a point where, although the enchants and smite enhancers are fairly solid, the Hunter's line is mostly serving for the purpose of keeping junglers away from lane minions (funneling penalties) and laners away from monsters (exp bonuses on camps, regen mechanics to offset the harshness of the jungle). As long as this function is kept, i believe things can be stable enough to discuss giving junglers Buy "Monsters" on iTunes:  Mackenzie Ziegler - Monsters (aka Haters) - Official Music Video!

Hey, I'm thinking about getting into converting monsters from previous editions into 5th edition and selling on DMs guild and I wanted to ask some questions. 1) Browsing through the DMsguild for monsters I notice some of the products use art from previous editions, does this mean you can use art from the previous editions when you make your conversion? 2) Are we allowed to convert monsters that were published by third party products under the Open Gamin license, like the monsters

The song (based on a Peter Straub story) describes an escalating series of murders, many disguised as accidents, that are actually the fault of a Creepy Kid (such a common monster I assume stats for one exist). It’s even got red herrings, a visual description, and a rant for when she’s discovered. The only thing you need to do is maybe give her supernatural powers, if you need a boss fight. I’d give her either Carrie or Samara from The Ring powers I guess.

Get it here: Subscribe for more official content Hey everyone, I was just wondering where I can find rules for all the races not mentioned in the PHB, that nevertheless seem to be commonly used as PCs such as Goblins, Goliaths and Aasimar. Is there a some (official) guide on how to convert monsters to playable races. Converting ADD 1st Edition Monsters (such as from, say, the Creature Compendium) to DD 5E  The conversion of classic monsters to 5E is actually pretty easy, and the rules for it are buried in code within the Dungeon Master's Guide itself. It's been a while since I've really had time to play, since I have a job that doesn't line up with my friend's schedules. But I still love DND and like to think about it. Inspired in part from the awesome Pokedex Monster Manual that someone made a few years back, I wanted to do something similar for one of my favorite JRPG series, Dragon Quest. I've already done some preliminary work. I made a list of about 100 monsters from throughout the franchise that i feel are iconic enough for conversi. One of the secret warehouses disappeared.

I'm trying to create an adventure sort of based on Jurassic Park. There's a moon that has a biosphere constructed on it containing different habitats and creatures living in it. Quick story even quicker, shit breaks while the party is visiting the park leading to a sort of sandbox where the players have to go around, collect a few things/save a few lives before getting off planet. I'm sort of struggling to dig through the Alien Archives to find enough creatures to populate the park for habitat.

Hi everyone, I'm intrigued by this new rule added with Pathfidner Unchained but I have a few questions about it. 1. If I use this rule for the players, should I apply this rule to monsters and NPCs? If yes, what would be the problem of having players using it and monsters and NPCs with their normal stablocks? 2. If some players want to use it and some not, would it be possible to let those use it while the others have normal WBL? Of course, this would be possible with the social contract.
