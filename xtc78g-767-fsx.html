Wondering Is Xplane Hi! I can't find any B767 for P3D v4, any of you got any working? Virtual Airline I'm in, those are the only planes with flights crossing the Atlantic and I'd like to make a couple of flights across Hello I have been flying since 2009 till 2015, but then Life got in the way. Long story short, I now bought my first HOTAS a few months ago (X55) I normally fly on DCS and I used to fly mainly on FSX and VATSIM. Now I want to get back to civil aviation but so much has changed. There's this p3dv4 already and I see its far superior to FSX, not even requiring you to use REX to get beautiful clouds like in the old days. Question is, which flight sim platform would you reccomend me ? I never. I‘m used to the PMDG 777 in FSX. Now that I use XPlane more and more I‘m missing a 777. Is the Flightfactor 777 worth its money? What are your guys opinions? Can you recomment. 
So its Christmas Time, so I've just picked up X-Plane and some wine. With it being half price on steam I deciced to take a little punt on it. Been and FSX user then FSX:SE so this is my first time in the X-Plane universe. I think am going to get Areosofts Manchester Airport became i live close, can see planes on final to 24L/R from my back windows. I know alot has been said about the MD-80 so maybe that? Plane i spend the most time in on FSX is the Majestic q-400. I do like regional  Please help me decide what developer I should buy from. Whether it's pay-ware or freeware doesn't matter 
Im having trouble with the LevelD- 767 for FSX where after its installed FSX just wont boot and it freezes and then CTD. Cant seem to use it with anything. Tried Simconnect but nope. Im using Windows 10 and my specs are: AMD FX-8350 Nvidia GTX 770 8GB RAM 240Gb SSd (FSX installed on here) 1TB HDD Gigabyte 990XA-UD3 Motherboard Corsair 650W PSU ps. the 767 worked alright ages ago when i had W7 installed so maybe thats. I'm trying to find a comment about how embry riddle just funnels money from you for a useless aviation degree? One comment i remember about it was talking a class just for programming a 767 FMS, using FSX ? Edit: thank you /u/dash_trash. So I had been a FSX guy my entire virtual piloting career. I had always been curious about X Plane but it was my understanding that you needed a fairly mighty machine to run it at any significant level of detail and my rig at the time could barley push out playable frames in FSX at any immersive level of detail. I had to step away from the flight deck for awhile when my life got hectic so I lost touch with the siming world. I am now in a more stable place with more time to spare so I decided. I had FSX with FSPax back in the day and it was awesome. Had the voiced and interactive co-pilot. It would automatically keep flight logs for you and rate your performance as a pilot even scoring your landings and a whole bunch of other features that really brought the sim alive I am a big immersion guy love to simulate ATP Ops but most of the stuff that comes with the flight models for XP11 is lack luster. I mean the Flight Factor A320 the cabin lights don't Hello ! Okay I know it's a tense topic and I'll do my best to be brief and not being downvoted (if I'm not already lol). I've always played flight sims on a moderate level. I have owned FS04, FSX and more recently P3D v3. I also own a mid to low-range laptop ( i5-7300HQ @3.5GHz, GTX1050Ti) with a decent joystick and rudder pedals. I've kept an eye out on the flight sim industry and since most add-ons have been further enhanced in their latest iteration to match XP11 and P3Dv4 I figured As always, this subreddit receives a huge volume of posts by people wondering what simulator would best suit them. A lot of the time these are simple and repetitive questions, but there is also the issue of people giving incorrect/biased advice, or questions going unanswered. This excellent guide, (https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/1ohhwr/a_what_simulator_should_i_try_guide/) while still somewhat relevant, is in need of a refresh in several areas. I've tried to adapt I'm getting into XP 11 after years and years with FSX and P3D and I'm looking to get one really solid (accurate, realistic, and mostly bug-free) airliner for it. I like to fly big cargo mostly so I've been looking at the FF 767. How is it these days with the latest 11.30-supported version? Worth a buy at its current price point? Does it hold a candle to PMDG if that's I want a payware Anyone know companies that sell xplane compatiable hardware? Seems like alot of the stuff i've seen is only for p3d/fsx. Looking for autopilot controls for the 767 or A320 and a MCDU for either. Thanks. 
Hey guys, I have a couple of ideas of new guides to work on but I thought I'd ask you first what would interest you most (no need to mention the DCS F-18/F-14, I know that lots of people want it yesterday).
